# featurepedia

a feature encyclopedia of tech platforms

## about

> Been thinking more and more lately about 'indieware' - <strong>replacement
> apps for popular apps that are in some way non-free</strong> - silos,
> monocultures, etc. And how, similar to what Stallman did with Unix in the 80s,
> we should <em>create replacements for all of these</em>. Rewrite the bread and
> butter apps of the web. But also adopting the Unix philosophy - not just
> rewriting monoliths, but piecing together small interchangeable utilities. We
> have most of the plumbing already, we just need to glue it together.

> piece by piece in a way that is open and free*.

## the plan

- we list out feature specifications for tech platforms dominated by monopolies, silos and monocultures
- we use these feature specifications to replace said platforms
- we don't just rebuild monoliths, we follow the unix philosophy and glue together stable components
- we recognise there's more than one way to skin a cat, so we focus on features and suggest various implementations of those features
- we cater to the myriad needs that exist - no one feature set fits all sizes
- you choose a selection of features, and get recommendations on what components, glued together, can fulfil your selection
- people share recipes of features
- the focus is on reuse, longevity, standards and decentralization
- we recognise that UX is as important as functionality, and endeavour to ensure the alternatives are open to everyone
- we recognise that sometimes an ide is better than a text editor, so welcome open source options that combine multiple pieces of a together
