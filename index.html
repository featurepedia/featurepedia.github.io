<h1>featurepedia</h1>
<p>a feature encyclopedia of tech platforms</p>

<h2>about</h2>

<blockquote>
    Been thinking more and more lately about 'indieware' - <strong>replacement apps for popular apps that are in some way non-free</strong> - silos, monocultures, etc. And how, similar to what Stallman did with Unix in the 80s, we should <em>create replacements for all of these</em>. Rewrite the bread and butter apps of the web. But also adopting the Unix philosophy - not just rewriting monoliths, but piecing together small interchangeable utilities. We have most of the plumbing already, we just need to glue it together.

<blockquote>
    I'd like to have <strong>a set of BDD-style specifications of what are important functions of modern apps</strong> - like specs and user stories of Facebook, Twitter, Evernote, Instagram, what have you - that document what these things do and why people want that. Then we <em>fulfil these features piece by piece in a way that is open and free</em>.

<blockquote>
    a "<strong>BDD Enciclopaedia of Tech Platforms</strong>"? Sounds cool, though it might be <em>a rather large undertaking</em>.

<h2>the plan</h2>

<ul>
    <li>we list out feature specifications for tech platforms dominated by monopolies, silos and monocultures</li>
    <li>we use these feature specifications to replace said platforms</li>
    <li>we don't just rebuild monoliths, we follow the unix philosophy and glue together stable components</li>
    <li>we recognise there's more than one way to skin a cat, so we focus on features and suggest various implementations of those features</li>
    <li>we cater to the myriad needs that exist - no one feature set fits all sizes</li>
    <li>you choose a selection of features, and get recommendations on what components, glued together, can fulfil your selection</li>
    <li>people share recipes of features</li>
    <li>the focus is on reuse, longevity, standards and decentralization</li>
    <li>we recognise that UX is as important as functionality, and endeavour to ensure the alternatives are open to everyone</li>
    <li>we recognise that sometimes an ide is better than a text editor, so welcome open source options that combine multiple pieces of a together</li>
</ul>

<h2>examples</h2>

<h3>todo tracking</h3>

<h4>Capability: Access across multiple devices</h4>

<pre>
Capability: Access across multiple devices

As a todo tracker,
In order to record things todo whenever they occur to me,
I want to be able to view my todos on multiple devices
</pre>

<p>
    Solution: use a file format that is supported by apps on multiple
devices.
</p>

<pre>
Feature: Todos can be edited on desktop
</pre>

<pre>
Feature: Todos can be edited on Android
</pre>

<hr/>

<h4>Capability: Easy sync across multiple devices</h4>
<pre>
Capability: Synchronisation across multiple devices

As a todo tracker,
In order to always have access to my latest list of things to do,
I want to have access to my todos on multiple devices
</pre>

<pre>
Feature: Automatic sync across multiple devices

As a todo tracker,
In order to always have access to my latest list of things to do,
I want to have my todos automatically sync between devices
</pre>
