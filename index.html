<h2>about</h2>

<blockquote>
Been thinking more and more lately about 'indieware' - replacement apps for popular apps that are in some way non-free - silos, monocultures, etc. And how, similar to what Stallman did with Unix in the 80s, we should create replacements for all of these. Rewrite the bread and butter apps of the web. But also adopting the Unix philosophy - not just rewriting monoliths, but piecing together small interchangeable utilities. We have most of the plumbing already, we just need to glue it together.

    I'd like to have a set of BDD-style specifications of what are important functions of modern apps - like specs and user stories of Facebook, Twitter, Evernote, Instagram, what have you - that document what these things do and why people want that. Then we fulfil these features piece by piece in a way that is open and free.

    a "<strong>BDD Enciclopaedia of Tech Platforms</strong>"? Sounds cool, though it might be <em>a rather large undertaking</em>.
