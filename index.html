<h2>about</h2>

<blockquote>
    Been thinking more and more lately about 'indieware' - <strong>replacement apps for popular apps that are in some way non-free</strong> - silos, monocultures, etc. And how, similar to what Stallman did with Unix in the 80s, we should <em>create replacements for all of these</em>. Rewrite the bread and butter apps of the web. But also adopting the Unix philosophy - not just rewriting monoliths, but piecing together small interchangeable utilities. We have most of the plumbing already, we just need to glue it together.

    I'd like to have <strong>a set of BDD-style specifications of what are important functions of modern apps</strong> - like specs and user stories of Facebook, Twitter, Evernote, Instagram, what have you - that document what these things do and why people want that. Then we <em>fulfil these features piece by piece in a way that is open and free</em>.

    a "<strong>BDD Enciclopaedia of Tech Platforms</strong>"? Sounds cool, though it might be <em>a rather large undertaking</em>.
